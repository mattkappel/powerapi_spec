The HPCS Manager/Resource Manager Interface is intended to provide the necessary functionality for the HPCS Manager to implement policy via the Resource Manager.
Policy information such as power caps (minimums or maximums), per user energy limits and traditional policies like node hours and priorities will all play a role in energy aware platform scheduling. 

\subsection{Supported Attributes}\label{sec:MgrRMAttributes}
The Power API specification does not currently recommend that any of the attributes be exposed to the HPCS Manager role. 
The implementation is free to expose any attribute they determine is useful to the user role without violating the specification.
