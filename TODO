1.  \printindex starts a new page, as does \chapter{index}

	Leaving out \chapter{index} removes the index from the table of contents,
	even when trying to force the issue with
	 \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Index}	

	Both imakeidx and idxlayout packages break the compile.


2.  Internal navigation is incomplete.

3.  Missing list of tables and list of features.
